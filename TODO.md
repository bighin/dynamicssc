# Ideas for the future

- Unified and uniform error messages, maybe introducing some fatal() function in auxx.c, or using perror()
- Use the code in molecules.c, with weights calculated on the flight.
- "Observable database", to make main.c tidier.
- (Together with the previous one) Flexible output system, with on-the flight compression and automatic header generation. HDF5?
